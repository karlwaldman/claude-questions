# HIGH: SEO Strategy Priority Decision

Based on SEORADAR analysis showing 421.3 monthly potential clicks, should we prioritize:

A) Quick Wins (31 keywords positions 4-10): Immediate traffic boost, low effort
B) Technical SEO Foundation (robots.txt, sitemaps, Core Web Vitals): Long-term foundation  
C) Content Gap Consolidation (real-time oil prices): Authority building
D) Untargeted High-Traffic Keywords (naturalgas live, ctrm oil): New content creation

Current performance: 94 daily sessions, 3 conversions/day
Critical issue: Machine Shop Directory has 0 sessions due to GSC access problems

Which approach would deliver the highest ROI for OilPriceAPI.com in the next 30 days?

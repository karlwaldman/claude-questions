# CLAUDE.md - Instructions for Claude Code

## Asking Questions When Blocked

When you need user input or encounter a decision point that requires human judgment, use the ask-claude.sh script:

### Setup (one-time)
```bash
# Download the script if not present
if [ ! -f "./ask-claude.sh" ]; then
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlwaldman/claude-questions/main/ask-claude.sh
    chmod +x ask-claude.sh
fi
```

### Usage

When you need to ask a question:

1. **For urgent decisions** (deployment, data deletion, security):
```bash
./ask-claude.sh urgent "Title" "Detailed question with context"
```

2. **For high priority** (architecture decisions, API changes):
```bash
./ask-claude.sh high "Title" "Question details"
```

3. **For normal questions** (feature clarifications, preferences):
```bash
./ask-claude.sh normal "Title" "Question details"
```

### Waiting for Response

After asking a question, wait for the user's response:

```bash
# Ask the question
QUESTION_FILE=$(./ask-claude.sh high "Database Migration" "Should I add indexes?" | grep -oP '(?<=questions/)[^ ]+')

# Wait for response (check every 30 seconds)
while ! ./ask-claude.sh check "$QUESTION_FILE" 2>/dev/null; do
    echo "Waiting for response..."
    sleep 30
done

# Get the response
RESPONSE=$(./ask-claude.sh check "$QUESTION_FILE")
echo "User responded: $RESPONSE"
```

### Example Scenarios

1. **Before destructive operations**:
```bash
./ask-claude.sh urgent "Delete User Data" "User has 500 records. Delete all data for user_id=123?"
```

2. **Architecture decisions**:
```bash
./ask-claude.sh high "API Design" "REST or GraphQL for the new orders service? Current stack uses REST."
```

3. **Clarifications**:
```bash
./ask-claude.sh normal "UI Preference" "Dark mode: CSS variables or separate stylesheets?"
```

## Status Updates

Keep the user informed of your progress using status updates:

### Posting Status Updates
```bash
# Post a status update
./ask-claude.sh status "Starting database migration task"
./ask-claude.sh status "Completed API endpoint implementation"
./ask-claude.sh status "Running test suite - 45/120 tests passed"
./ask-claude.sh status "BLOCKED: Missing AWS credentials"
```

### When to Use Status Updates
- Starting a complex multi-step task
- Completing major milestones
- When blocked and waiting for something
- After fixing significant issues
- Progress updates on long-running operations

## Important Notes

- Always provide context in your questions
- Include relevant code snippets or error messages
- Mention consequences of different choices
- The user will be notified and can respond from any device
- Status updates help the user track your progress across projects
